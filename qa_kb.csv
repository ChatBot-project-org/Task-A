Question,Answer
"What is AI?","AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which involves building systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence."
"How does machine learning work?","Machine learning uses data to train models to recognize patterns and make predictions."
"What is deep learning?","Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to learn hierarchical representations."
"What is NLP?","Natural Language Processing focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language."
"Explain supervised learning","Supervised learning trains on labeled data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs."
"Explain unsupervised learning","Unsupervised learning discovers structure in unlabeled data, such as clusters or latent factors."
"What is reinforcement learning?","Reinforcement learning trains agents to make decisions by maximizing cumulative reward through trial and error."
"What is overfitting?","Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data and fails to generalize to new data."
"What is underfitting?","Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data."
"What is regularization?","Regularization discourages overly complex models to improve generalization, e.g., L1/L2 penalties or dropout."
"What is cross validation?","Cross-validation evaluates a model by training and testing on multiple folds of the data to estimate generalization."
"What is a confusion matrix?","A confusion matrix summarizes classification performance across predicted vs actual classes."
"What is accuracy?","Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions among all predictions."
"What is precision?","Precision is the fraction of predicted positives that are actually positive."
"What is recall?","Recall is the fraction of actual positives that were correctly identified."
"What is F1 score?","F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall."
"What is cosine similarity?","Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors; higher means more similar direction."
"What is TF-IDF?","TF-IDF weights terms higher if they are frequent in a document but rare across the corpus."
"Why use n-grams?","N-grams capture short phrases like 'neural network' that single tokens may miss."
"What are stop words?","Stop words are very common words (e.g., 'the', 'and') often removed to reduce noise."
"What is gradient descent?","Gradient descent iteratively updates parameters in the direction that reduces the loss function."
"What is backpropagation?","Backpropagation efficiently computes gradients in neural networks via the chain rule."
"What is a learning rate?","The learning rate controls the size of parameter updates during optimization."
"What is early stopping?","Early stopping halts training when validation performance stops improving to avoid overfitting."
"Why use a validation set?","A validation set helps tune hyperparameters and check generalization during training."
